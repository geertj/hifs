Changes for hifs.

Changes from 1.3 to 1.4
-Bug fixes! 1.3 reached a big audience and with their bug reports I was able 
 to shake some stupid, some nifty bugs out.
-Added delay and diskfree option to the configfile.
-Added command line options.
-Don't wait for the user if a warning was issued unless in debug mode.
-Rewrote part of the manpage.
-Removed global configuration file. Only .hifsrc remains.
-Dynamically detect format of /proc/meminfo as the format keeps changing.
-In setuid version: prevent coredumps.
-Runtime shadow/normal password detection.
-Verbose banner.
-Better wchan support. Also try to read wchans from /boot/System.map and 
 some other locations: same behaviour as ps(1).
-Detection of possible too short delay between data updates.

Changes from 1.2 to 1.3
-Massive restructuring of the source. Things should be reasonably clean now.
-Only check selected fs-types for diskspace.
-New key bindings: I almost used up the entire alfabet, so I decided to do
 things differently. The sort/info/mem modes are now a toggle, so they need
 a total of only three keys. This way, hifs uses much less keys now.
-Hifs is more verbose now to the user.
-Changed utmp handling do go via libc and not via read(). This is cleaner.
-Added priority info mode.
-The configfile is now parsed via bison/flex. Extended syntax, like C-style
 strings in the configfile.
-Only one include file now: hifs.h. Everthing is included and defined here.
-New get_string() function that has some command-line editing and isn't as
 braindead as the ncurses mvinnstr() function.
-The update period can be real now, instead of only integer.
-Removed defaults.h.
-Hifs compiles cleanly under glibc-2. Fixed include files: don't include
 from asm/ and linux/ anymore.
-Changed to using autoconf instead of home-brew ./configure script.
-Added global configuration file. Search order is: $HOME/.hifsrc,
 $LIBDIR/hifs/system.hifsrc
-Added support for /proc/meminfo of kernel > 2.1.40.
-Runtime kernel version detection instead of compile time. This gives on hifs
 binary for all kernels.

Changes from 1.1 to 1.2
-Changed layout. First column is always process-name. Second is sorted on,
 and the third column can be freely chosen. This seems more intuitive.
-Added wchan info mode.
-Fixed "/proc is full" bug, when proc device is called something other than
 "none". (thanx: Masale).
-Pause when a warning is issued during initialisation.

Changes from first release to 1.1:
-Added verion number ...
-Added command-line info mode.
-Added delay option.
-Messaged are queued now, so only the most important messaged is shown.
-Added configure script, that looks for kernel and libc version.
-Removed System V IPC! 
-Removed fork(). Hifs is only one process now!
-Added (optional) setuid feature.
-Added more functionality to the "configure" script.
-Added renice feature.
-Added 'K' option: kill with SIGKILL right away.
-Added a configfile, for group, id, show and mem defaults (see manpage).
-100% is now 100%, instead of 100.8 %.

Version 1.0 didn't really have a version number, it was just "hifs". 
But I thought it would be easy after all, to have version numbers.
