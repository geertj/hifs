  Hifs: Handy Information For Sysadmins 1.4, November 1997

      To learn more about hifs: see the manpage, `hifs.1'. For the copying
  policy, see the file COPYING (hifs is GPL software).

  Compilation hints:

	  In the file INSTALL there are generic install instructions. However,
  the following instructions should build and install hifs in almost all 
  circumstances. If you build the setuid version of hifs, you can su to root
  from within hifs. You do this by giving --enable-su-to-root as an argument 
  to configure.

	  ~/hifs> mkdir compile; cd compile
	  ~/hifs> ../configure --help
	  ~/hifs> ../configure [--enable-su-to-root]
	  ~/hifs> make; make install

  Setuid version:

	  If hifs is compiled with the su-to-root option,  hifs will be a setuid 
  root program and therefore inherently insecure. I put a lot of effort in 
  creating secure code, but I can't make any guarantees about security. Having 
  said this, this is what hifs does to prevent abuse:

   o Drop priviliges right away.
   o Take care that buffer overruns don't occur.
   o Verbose syslog() reporting.

  Latest version:

      The latest version of hifs is available via anonymous ftp at 
  skynet.stack.nl in /pub/linux/hifs.

  Author:

	  Linux Hifs is created by Geert Jansen (geertj@stack.nl). It is inspired 
  by the original FreeBSD version created by Sven Berkvens (sven@stack.nl).
